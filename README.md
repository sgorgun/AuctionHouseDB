***An Auction House Database***

The company sells antiques and artwork at auction. The owners of items put up for auction by the company are legal sellers. The people
who purchase these items are referred to as buyers. After receiving a batch of items from the sellers, the firm decides at which auction it
will be more profitable to present a particular item. Before the next auction, each item displayed is assigned a separate lot number,
which plays the same role as the product code entered before. Two items sold at different auctions may have the same lot numbers. The
details about each auction are recorded by the company. The date, place, and time are noted, as well as any other specifics (for
example, oil paintings from before 1900). Information about each item sold is also entered: the auction for which it is claimed, the lot
number, the seller, the starting price, and a brief verbal description. The seller is allowed to display any number of items, and the buyer
can purchase any number of items. The same person or firm can act as both a seller and a buyer. After the auction, employees of the
auction house record the actual price paid for an item and the buyer's data.
